# Ranger Sound Sensor Arduino Sketch - Bonus Point Attempt

This repository contains an Arduino sketch that executes commands and responds to sound detection. In response, the robot will be able to react with lights and noises to indicate the measured amount of noise.

The sketch utilizes the command pattern to process various commands based on the sound emitted and translate that into movement or display LED lights.

Script is in `/ranger_sound` and can be compiled and uploaded via Arduino IDE or arduino-cli.
